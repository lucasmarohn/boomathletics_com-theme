    <p class="a-card__desc">I have been weightlifting since I was 12 years old and I've been a certified personal trainer since age 18. I have worked with hundreds of clients over the years and have helped many people write their success stories. I have trained professional athletes, special needs populations, extreme weight loss clients, and post rehabilitation clients. I believe proper fitness is a large factor in physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. It is an honor to help my friends and neighbors accomplish their goals.</p>
